hi Andy Le I wonder if there is an
issue with the tracking detalils
notification email being sent to

the customer when we fill out the
AfterShip detalls and place the order
in "Order In Transit" status...

Based on Harshs estimate, its

a 50/50 successful rate of end
customers actually receiving the sa√Øid
email, which is very concerning to
me!

ls there a way to check? Ta
